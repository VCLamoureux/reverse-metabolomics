# Reverse-metabolomics

This is the code repository to perform reverse metabolomics.

----------------------------------------
### System requirements
This code has been tested on `Apple MacBook Pro` Sonoma version 14.5 (specifications: Apple M2 max, 64 GB RAM, 38 cores GPU, 12 cores CPU) and `Windows 11` version 23H2 (specifications: 13th Gen Intel(R) core (TM) i7-13850HX, 2100 Mhz, 32 GB RAM, 20 cores, 28 logical processors). 

----------------------------------------
### Installation guide
#### R version
The following packages should be installed: 
- data.table (>= 1.15.4)
- tidyverse (>= 2.0.0)
- pheatmap (>= 1.0.12)

The installation time should be about 30 seconds

#### Python version
The following packages should be installed: 
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

The installation time should be less than 20 seconds

For users new to Python, we recommend that the code be run on a cloud-based platform such as Google Colab, as this tends to make plot rendering easier and more standardized, in addition to providing the user with more memory, allowing for a greater portion of the metadata table to be read in at once



It should be noted that package installation times may vary depending on the user's network latency and processor
